# Events Platform

## Project Overview
The Events Platform is a web-based application designed to help communities easily organize, manage, and participate in events. Originally envisioned as a Manchester-specific application, it was created to foster a community-driven approach in an ever-expanding city. This platform allows users to browse upcoming events, sign up for them, and integrate them with Google Calendar. Additionally, staff members have special privileges to create and manage events, ensuring smooth event coordination.

The **backend** of the platform was built using **Express.js** and is hosted on **Render** at [SE Events Backend](https://se-events-platform-be.onrender.com/). This ensures a reliable API for handling authentication, event management, and user interactions.

The **frontend** was developed using **React**, allowing for dynamic rendering and efficient re-renders without requiring users to refresh or close the browser. This enhances the user experience by providing smooth, real-time updates to the event listings and user interactions.

## Live Demo
